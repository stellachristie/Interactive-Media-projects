# Interactive-Media-projects
The project is about making an interactive scenery (require to make a landscape and sliders to control crowds entering background and lighting components) usingdata from Building 11. To visualise this, our data is sourced from UTS FEIT EIF Research data where the targetted time is from the 22/4/21 - 22/5/21. This information will allow users to deduce the busiest time of the month and how the lighting usage would be influenced by this, and also, they allow to see if there is a correlation between the number of people entering the building and the lighting consumption.
